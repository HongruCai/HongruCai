# ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I am now a Master student in the School of Computing at <a href='https://nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore(NUS)</a>. I received my Bachelor degree from Institute of Artificial Intelligence at <a href='https://www.buaa.edu.cn/'>Beihang University(BUAA)</a> in 2023.

To fully discover my potential, I have been working on a wide range of research topics. My previous research experience includes Computer Vision, Robot Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.

I am currently working on Cross-Modal Generative Retrieval in <a href='https://www.nextcenter.org/'>NExT++</a> with <a href='https://liyongqi67.github.io/'>Dr. Yongqi Li</a> and <a href='https://wenjiewwj.github.io/'>Dr. Wenjie Wang</a>. 

I am eager to participate more cutting-edge research projects and I will always be passionate about creating a better world with AI tools and technologies. I am looking forward to pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the future.
